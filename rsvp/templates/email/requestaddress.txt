  Since we used an electronic invitation, we don't have your mailing address and we need it for a super secret surprise. Please send us your mailing address by responding to this email or going to {{ address_link }}.

  Let's keep in touch -- in Menlo Park, through the phone/email/chat, or on a trip!

Best,

Aneesh & Sherry

PS: Don't forget to share photos! We'd love to post them on the wedding website, just <strong>upload them to Dropbox</strong> (<a href="{{ dropbox_link }}">szar.us/dropbox</a>), <strong>share them on Facebook</strong> (tagging either Aneesh or Sherry and including the word 'wedding', 'shereesh2016', or 'szar2016' in the caption), or <strong>email individually or zipped</strong> to <a href="mailto:pictures@szar.us">pictures@szar.us</a>
